Functions
# ----------
Functions in Powershell are groups of code collected in a single location that can be referenced anywhere in your code.
Functions are a way to collect code in a single space and reference them with a simple command throughout your script.
This makes code easier to read.

function greet {
  Write-Host "Hello, there!"
}
